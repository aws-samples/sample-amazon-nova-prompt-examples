## Summary ##

This code defines a class `ApiPoller` that repeatedly polls an API endpoint with specified parameters and saves the response to a file. It includes retry logic with exponential backoff and optional jitter, logging, and different methods to handle various response types.

## Example ##
```python
# Example usage of the ApiPoller class

# Initialize the ApiPoller with specific parameters
poller = ApiPoller(
    endpoint_url="https://api.example.com/data",
    output_file="output/response.json",
    base_delay=2.0,
    max_delay=30.0,
    max_retries=3,
    jitter=True,
    timeout=15,
    headers={"Authorization": "Bearer your_token"}
)

# Poll the API with GET method and specific parameters
response = poller.poll(method="GET", params={"key": "value"})

# The response will be saved to "output/response.json" and also returned
print(response)
```
