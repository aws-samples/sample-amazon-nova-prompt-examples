To answer this question, I need to:
1. Identify customers who have made purchases over $1000 in the last 30 days.
2. Calculate the total spend and number of orders for each of these customers.
3. Sort the results by total spend in descending order.

Steps:
1. Use the `orders` table to filter orders made in the last 30 days and where the amount is greater than $1000.
2. Join the `customers` table to get customer details.
3. Group by `customer_id` to calculate the total spend (`SUM(amount)`) and count the number of orders (`COUNT(order_id)`).
4. Sort the results by total spend in descending order.

```sql
SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    c.customer_name,
    SUM(o.amount) AS total_spend,
    COUNT(o.order_id) AS number_of_orders
FROM 
    customers c
JOIN 
    orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE 
    o.order_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
    AND o.amount > 1000
GROUP BY 
    c.customer_id
ORDER BY 
    total_spend DESC;
```

### Notes ###
- The `WHERE` clause filters orders made in the last 30 days and with an amount greater than $1000.
- The `JOIN` clause connects the `customers` and `orders` tables using the `customer_id`.
- The `GROUP BY` clause groups the results by `customer_id` to calculate aggregates.
- The `ORDER BY` clause sorts the results by `total_spend` in descending order.
