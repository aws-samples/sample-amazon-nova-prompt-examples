## Explanation ##

This code creates a special function called `memoize` that helps other functions remember their results. Imagine you have a friend who loves to solve puzzles but sometimes forgets the answers. You decide to write down the answers to puzzles they've already solved so they don't have to solve the same puzzle again. That's what this `memoize` function does for other functions.

When you use `memoize` with a function, it keeps a record of the inputs and outputs. If the function is called again with the same inputs, it just looks up the saved result instead of doing all the work again. This saves time and makes the function faster.

## Components ##

1. **`def memoize(func):`**: This line defines a new function named `memoize` that takes another function (`func`) as input. Think of `memoize` as a helper that will make `func` more efficient.

2. **`cache = {}`**: Inside `memoize`, we create an empty dictionary called `cache`. This dictionary will store the results of `func` for different inputs, like a notebook where you write down puzzle answers.

3. **`def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):`**: This line defines a new function inside `memoize` called `wrapper`. This `wrapper` function will be the one that actually gets called instead of `func`. It takes any number of arguments (`*args`) and keyword arguments (`**kwargs`).

4. **`key = str(args) + str(sorted(kwargs.items()))`**: Here, we create a unique key for the cache based on the inputs to the function. We convert the arguments to a string and sort the keyword arguments to ensure the key is consistent for the same inputs.

5. **`if key not in cache:`**: We check if the key (combination of inputs) is already in the cache. If it’s not, that means we haven’t solved this puzzle before.

6. **`cache[key] = func(*args, **kwargs)`**: If the key is not in the cache, we call the original function `func` with the given arguments and store the result in the cache.

7. **`return cache[key]`**: Finally, we return the result from the cache. If it was already there, we just look it up. If not, we stored it right before returning.

## Example ##

Let's see how this works with a simple example. Suppose we have a function that calculates the factorial of a number, and we want to make it more efficient using `memoize`.

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

# Apply memoize to the factorial function
memoized_factorial = memoize(factorial)

# Calculate factorial(5) for the first time
print(memoized_factorial(5))  # This will calculate and store the result

# Calculate factorial(5) again
print(memoized_factorial(5))  # This will use the stored result
```

In this example, the first time we call `memoized_factorial(5)`, it calculates the result and stores it in the cache. The second time we call it with the same input, it just retrieves the result from the cache without doing the calculation again.
