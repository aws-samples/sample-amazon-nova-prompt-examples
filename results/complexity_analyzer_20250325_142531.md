## Time Analysis ##
- **Overall Big O notation**: O(n log n)
- **Breakdown of operations**:
  - Iterating through the array: O(n)
  - Checking if an element is in a set: O(1) on average
  - Adding an element to a set: O(1) on average
  - Sorting the list of pairs: O(n log n)
- **Best, average, and worst cases**:
  - **Best case**: O(n log n) – When the array is small or already contains pairs that sum to the target.
  - **Average case**: O(n log n) – The average scenario involves iterating through the array and performing constant-time operations for set lookups and insertions, followed by sorting.
  - **Worst case**: O(n log n) – When no optimizations are possible and the final sorting step dominates the runtime.

## Space Analysis ##
- **Overall Big O notation**: O(n)
- **Memory usage breakdown**:
  - The set `seen` requires O(n) space in the worst case, where all elements are unique.
  - The list `pairs` requires O(n) space in the worst case, where every pair sums to the target.
  - Sorting the list of pairs does not significantly increase space complexity beyond O(n) due to the nature of in-place sorting algorithms used by Python’s `sorted()` function.
- **Any optimizations possible**:
  - The space used by `seen` and `pairs` is necessary for the algorithm's functionality. However, if the order of pairs is not required, skipping the final sort could save O(n log n) time complexity but would not reduce space complexity.

## Recommendations ##
- **Avoiding the final sort**: If the order of pairs is not crucial, removing the sorting step can improve time complexity to O(n).
  ```python
  def find_pairs_with_sum(arr, target_sum):
      pairs = []
      seen = set()
      
      for num in arr:
          complement = target_sum - num
          if complement in seen:
              pairs.append((min(num, complement), max(num, complement)))
          seen.add(num)
          
      return pairs
  ```
- This change will make the function run in O(n) time complexity while maintaining O(n) space complexity.
