## Analysis ##
The function `group_by_frequency` needs to process a list of hashable items and produce a dictionary where:
- The keys are the frequencies of the items in the input list.
- The values are lists of items that appear with that frequency.
- The items within each list should be sorted in their natural order.
- If the input list is empty, the function should return an empty dictionary.

### Input/Output Specifications
- **Input**: A list of hashable items (e.g., integers, strings, tuples).
- **Output**: A dictionary where:
  - Keys are integers representing frequencies.
  - Values are lists of items that appear with that frequency, sorted in natural order.

### Edge Cases to Handle
1. **Empty Input**: The function should return an empty dictionary if the input list is empty.
2. **Single Unique Item**: If the list contains only one unique item, the result should reflect that item's frequency.
3. **All Items Same Frequency**: If all items appear the same number of times, the result should have a single key-value pair.
4. **Mixed Frequencies**: The function should correctly handle lists with items of varying frequencies.

### Potential Optimizations
- Use `collections.Counter` to efficiently count the frequencies of items.
- Use `collections.defaultdict` to group items by their frequencies.
- Sort the items within each frequency group to ensure they are in natural order.

## Code ##
```python
from collections import Counter, defaultdict

def group_by_frequency(items: list) -> dict:
    """
    Group items by their frequency of occurrence in the input list.

    Parameters:
    items (list): A list of hashable items.

    Returns:
    dict: A dictionary where keys are frequencies and values are lists of items
          that appear with that frequency, sorted in natural order.
    """
    if not items:
        return {}
    
    # Count the frequency of each item
    frequency_count = Counter(items)
    
    # Group items by their frequency
    grouped_by_frequency = defaultdict(list)
    for item, frequency in frequency_count.items():
        grouped_by_frequency[frequency].append(item)
    
    # Sort items within each frequency group
    for frequency in grouped_by_frequency:
        grouped_by_frequency[frequency].sort()
    
    # Convert defaultdict to regular dict
    return dict(grouped_by_frequency)

## Example ##
```python
# Example usage of the group_by_frequency function
print(group_by_frequency([1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3]))  # Output: {1: [3], 2: [1], 3: [2]}
print(group_by_frequency([]))                  # Output: {}
print(group_by_frequency([1]))                  # Output: {1: [1]}
print(group_by_frequency([1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]))  # Output: {2: [1, 3], 3: [2]}
