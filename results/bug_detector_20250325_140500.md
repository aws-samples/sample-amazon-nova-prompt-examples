## Issues ##
1. **Actual Bug**: 
   - In `process_data`, when `item` is an integer or float, `calculate_average(item)` is called. This is incorrect because `calculate_average` expects a list, not a single number.
   
2. **Actual Bug**:
   - In `process_data`, empty lists are appended to the results without calculating an average, which may not be the intended behavior.

3. **Potential Runtime Issue**:
   - Division by zero is possible in `calculate_average` if an empty list is passed, though this is somewhat handled by the second bug above.

4. **Style/Maintainability Concern**:
   - The type checking using `type(item) in [int, float]` and `type(item) == list` is not Pythonic. It would be better to use `isinstance`.

5. **Style/Maintainability Concern**:
   - The function `calculate_average` does not handle the case where the input list is empty, which should be addressed to avoid division by zero.

## Impact ##
1. The first bug causes a `TypeError` because `calculate_average` is called with a single number instead of a list.
2. The second bug means that empty lists are not handled correctly, leading to potentially incorrect results or unexpected behavior.
3. Without proper handling of empty lists, a division by zero error could occur in `calculate_average`.
4. Using `isinstance` instead of `type` checks makes the code more Pythonic and easier to maintain.
5. Not handling empty lists in `calculate_average` can lead to runtime errors and makes the function less robust.

## Fixed Code ##
```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    if not numbers:  # Check for empty list
        return 0  # or some other appropriate value or behavior
    total = 0
    for num in numbers:
        total += num
    return total / len(numbers)

def process_data(data_list):
    results = []
    for item in data_list:
        if isinstance(item, (int, float)):  # Use isinstance for type checking
            results.append(item)  # Single numbers are appended as is
        elif isinstance(item, list):  # Use isinstance for type checking
            avg = calculate_average(item)
            results.append(avg)
    return results

# Example usage
data = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    4,
    [],
    [5, 6]
]
print(process_data(data))  # Should now work correctly
```

## Comments on Fixes ##
- Added a check for empty lists in `calculate_average` to return 0, avoiding division by zero.
- Changed type checks in `process_data` to use `isinstance` for better practice.
- Ensured that single numbers are appended directly to the results list without attempting to calculate an average.
- Handled empty lists by calculating their average as 0 in `calculate_average`.
