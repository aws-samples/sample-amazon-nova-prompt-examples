### Analysis ###
To address this task, we need to perform the following steps:

1. **Remove the sensitive data from the commit**:
   - We need to remove the `config/credentials.json` file from the last commit while keeping other changes intact. This can be done using `git rm --cached`.

2. **Amend the last commit**:
   - After removing the sensitive file, we need to amend the last commit to reflect this change. This can be done using `git commit --amend`.

3. **Ensure the credentials are ignored in future commits**:
   - We need to add `config/credentials.json` to `.gitignore` to prevent it from being tracked in future commits.

4. **Potential risks and considerations**:
   - Amending a commit that hasnâ€™t been pushed is safe, but if the commit had been pushed, amending it would require force-pushing, which can be risky if others are working on the same branch.
   - Ensure that the `.gitignore` file is committed so that the ignore rule is shared with other collaborators.

5. **Alternative approaches**:
   - Another approach could be to use `git reset` to undo the commit, make the changes, and then re-commit. However, `git commit --amend` is more straightforward for this specific scenario.

### Commands ###
```bash
# Step 1: Remove the sensitive file from the last commit
git rm --cached config/credentials.json

# Step 2: Amend the last commit
git commit --amend --no-edit

# Step 3: Add the sensitive file to .gitignore
echo "config/credentials.json" >> .gitignore

# Step 4: Commit the .gitignore changes
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Add config/credentials.json to .gitignore"
```

### Explanation ###
- `git rm --cached config/credentials.json`: This command removes the `config/credentials.json` file from the staging area but keeps it in the working directory. This ensures that the file is no longer tracked by Git but remains on your local filesystem.
- `git commit --amend --no-edit`: This amends the last commit to remove the `config/credentials.json` file. The `--no-edit` flag keeps the original commit message unchanged.
- `echo "config/credentials.json" >> .gitignore`: This appends the `config/credentials.json` file to the `.gitignore` file, ensuring it is ignored in future commits.
- `git add .gitignore`: This stages the updated `.gitignore` file.
- `git commit -m "Add config/credentials.json to .gitignore"`: This commits the changes to the `.gitignore` file with a descriptive message.
