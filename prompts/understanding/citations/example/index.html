<h1 id="citations">Citations</h1>
<p>Most document chat use cases require citations from the corpus of text being questioned. This substantiates the answer provided back to the user, and offers a reliable way to trace back to the source of the answer.
This approach to citations leverages Chain of Thought prompting best practices as laid out in our <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/nova/latest/userguide/prompting-chain-of-thought.html">documentation</a>.</p>
<h3 id="system-prompt-template">System Prompt Template</h3>
<pre><code>You are an AI assistant that answers questions about documents and correctly cites your sources of information in the document. 
Follow these instructions:
1. Read and understand the question asked under &lt;question&gt;.
2. Read through the &lt;document_content&gt; and find the answer to the question. 
3. Think step-by-step about how the &lt;document_content&gt; may or may not answer the question, and put your thoughts in &lt;thinking&gt; tags.
4. If you find an answer in the document, format your citation in a list as follows and put into &lt;citation&gt; tags: 
    [
        {
            "pageNumber": "the number of the pages where the answer was found",
            "text": "The literal, verbatim text found that answers the question",
            "section": "A best effort description of the section where the answer was found"
        }
    ]
5. Put your answer in &lt;answer&gt; tags, and ground it in facts using only whats in &lt;document_content&gt;
6. If you can't find the answer in the text, just say empty answer tags &lt;answer&gt;&lt;/answer&gt;. Its ok if you can't find the answer!

<span class="s2">28Rainbow Salad with Spicy Peanut Dressing</span>
<span class="s2">Adapted from A Spoonful of Ginger  by Nina Simonds</span>
<span class="s2">Makes 6 servings</span>
<span class="s2">INGREDIENTS</span>
<span class="s2">14 ounces firm tofu, cut into ½ inch slabs</span>
<span class="s2">½ pound whole wheat spaghetti</span>
<span class="s2">1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil</span>
<span class="s2">2 cups grated carrots</span>
<span class="s2">1½ cups grated cucumbers, seeds and skin removed</span>
<span class="s2">1½ cups grated red cabbage</span>
<span class="s2">1 red bell pepper, cored, seeded, and sliced into thin strips</span>
<span class="s2">1 yellow pepper, cored seeded, and sliced into thin strips</span>
<span class="s2">SPICY PEANUT DRESSING</span>
<span class="s2">2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger</span>
<span class="s2">½ tablespoon minced garlic</span>
<span class="s2">1 teaspoon hot chili paste, or more to taste</span>
<span class="s2">½ cup smooth peanut butter</span>
<span class="s2">¼ cup reduced-sodium soy sauce</span>
<span class="s2">1 tablespoon sugar</span>
<span class="s2">2 tablespoons Chinese black vinegar or balsamic vinegar</span>
<span class="s2">3 tablespoons toasted sesame oil</span>
<span class="s2">¼ cup water</span>
<span class="s2">DIRECTIONS</span>
<span class="s2">1. Wrap the tofu slabs in paper towels or a cotton towel and place a heavy weight, such as a </span>
<span class="s2">cast-iron skillet, on top. Let stand for 30 minutes to press out the excess water, then cut the </span>
<span class="s2">tofu into matchstick-size shreds about 2 inches long. </span>
<span class="s2">2. Bring 3 quarts water to a boil, add the spaghetti, and cook until just tender. Drain in a </span>
<span class="s2">colander, toss with the sesame oil, and arrange on a platter. </span>
<span class="s2">3. Arrange the carrots, cucumbers, bean sprouts, red and yellow pepper strips, and tofu in </span>
<span class="s2">mounds or separate concentric circles on the serving platter with the noodles. </span>
<span class="s2">4. To prepare the Spicy Peanut Dressing: In a food processor fitted with a steel blade or a </span>
<span class="s2">blender, chop the ginger and garlic until fine. Add the remaining ingredients in descending </span>
<span class="s2">order, ending with the water. Process until smooth. The sauce should have the consistency </span>
<span class="s2">of heavy cream. If it is too thick, add more water; if too thin, add more peanut butter. Pour </span>
<span class="s2">the sauce into a serving container, and offer the vegetables and sauce to each diner to mix as </span>
<span class="s2">desired. </span>
